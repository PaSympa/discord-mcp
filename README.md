A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP) server that lets Claude control Discord:
read/send messages, manage members, roles, channels, and permissions.

## Features

- **45 tools** covering messages, channels, roles, permissions, moderation, and more
- Full **permission management** — audit, copy, and override channel permissions
- **Moderation** — kick, ban, timeout, bulk delete, audit log
- **Rich messages** — embeds, reactions, threads, pins, search
- **Membership screening** — view and update server rules for new members
- Modular architecture — easy to extend with new tools

---

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repo and run `npm install && npm run build`
2. Set `DISCORD_TOKEN` in your environment or a `.env` file
3. Add the server to your Claude Desktop config (see [Configuration](#configuration))
4. Restart Claude Desktop

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 18
- A **Discord Bot** with its token
- Claude Desktop (or any MCP-compatible client)

---

## Installation

```bash
cd discord-mcp

npm install

npm run build
```

---

## Creating Your Discord Bot

1. Go to [discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. **New Application** > give it a name
3. **Bot** tab > **Reset Token** > copy the token
4. Enable **Privileged Gateway Intents**:
   - Server Members Intent
   - Message Content Intent
5. **OAuth2 > URL Generator**:
   - Scopes: `bot`
   - Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Manage Channels`, `Manage Roles`, `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Moderate Members`, `View Audit Log`, `Manage Messages`, `Manage Threads`, `Add Reactions`, `Manage Guild`
6. Copy the generated URL and invite the bot to your server

## Configuration

### Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "discord": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/discord-mcp/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### .env file (alternative)

Instead of passing the token in the MCP config, you can create a `.env` file at the project root:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

The server loads `.env` automatically via `dotenv`.

### Adding a new tool

1. Create a new file in `src/tools/` (e.g. `onboarding.ts`)
2. Export `definitions` (tool schemas) and `handle()` (tool logic)
3. Import and add it to the `modules` array in `src/tools/index.ts`

---

## Security

- Never commit your Discord token to Git
- Use environment variables or a `.env` file (not versioned)
- Give the bot only the permissions it needs

---
